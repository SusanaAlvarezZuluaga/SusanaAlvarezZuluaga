## About my self
I'm a Mathematical Engineering student passionate about applied math and its different coding applications. Through my career as a mathematician, I have coded for different purposes such as solving complex optimization problems, solving differential equations numerically, performing statistical analyses, and others. After acquiring experience in the industry I have realized that what I am most passionate about is coding for a development purpose which is why I decided to become a Full-Stack Web Developer.
