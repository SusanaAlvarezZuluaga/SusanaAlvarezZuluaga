## About my self
I'm a Mathematical Engineering student passionate about applied math and its different coding applications. Through my career as a mathematician I have coded for different purposes, such as solving complex optimization problems, solving differential equations numerically, performing statistical analyses, and others. After acquiring experience in the industry I have realized that what I am most passionate about is coding for a development purpose which is why I decided to become a Full-Stack Web Developer by completing a 5 month bootcamp where I learned new technologies such as React and Node and strengthened my knowledge on JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## About my repositories
Since I am both a Mathematical Engineer and a Full-Stack Web Developer, you can find repositories in my github that are related to either one of these professions. Below is a list of the repostories available in my GitHub as well as the projects I have deployed.
